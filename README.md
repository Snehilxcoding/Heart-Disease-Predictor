# Heart Disease Predictor

## Introduction

This project focuses on predicting the presence and severity of heart disease using machine learning techniques. The goal was to analyze patient health data, identify patterns associated with heart disease, and build predictive models that can assist in early diagnosis.

The project was developed using the Heart Disease UCI dataset and follows a complete data science workflow, starting from data cleaning and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

## Problem Statement

Heart disease is one of the most common health concerns worldwide. Detecting potential risks at an early stage can help medical professionals make informed decisions and improve patient outcomes.

The objective of this project is to use historical patient data and machine learning algorithms to predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease and understand the factors that contribute to the prediction.

## Dataset Information

The project uses the Heart Disease UCI dataset, which contains various medical attributes collected from patients.

Some of the important features in the dataset include:

* Age
* Gender
* Chest Pain Type
* Resting Blood Pressure
* Cholesterol Level
* Fasting Blood Sugar
* Resting ECG Results
* Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
* Exercise-Induced Angina
* ST Depression (Oldpeak)
* Number of Major Vessels
* Thalassemia Type
* Heart Disease Severity (Target Variable)

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Understanding

The dataset was first explored to understand the meaning of each feature, identify missing values, and examine the distribution of the target variable.

### 2. Data Cleaning

Several preprocessing techniques were applied, including:

* Handling missing values
* Treating inconsistent data
* Managing categorical variables
* Feature engineering where required

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA was performed to gain insights into the dataset and understand how different medical attributes relate to heart disease.

This included:

* Distribution analysis
* Correlation analysis
* Class distribution study
* Feature relationship analysis

### 4. Data Preprocessing

Before training the models, the data was prepared using:

* One-Hot Encoding
* Feature Scaling using StandardScaler
* Train-Test Splitting

### 5. Model Building

Multiple machine learning algorithms were implemented and compared, including:

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier
* K-Means Clustering (for pattern analysis)

### 6. Model Evaluation

The performance of the models was assessed using:

* Accuracy Score
* Confusion Matrix
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-Score
* Classification Report

## Key Findings

During the analysis, a few factors showed a strong relationship with heart disease prediction:

* Chest pain type was one of the most influential features.
* Exercise-induced angina showed a significant association with heart disease.
* Higher oldpeak values were often linked with increased risk.
* Maximum heart rate achieved also played an important role in prediction.
* Age and cholesterol contributed to the prediction but were not always the strongest indicators.
